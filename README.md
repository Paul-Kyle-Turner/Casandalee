# Dungeons and Dragons Rules Lawyer

DnD is great game to play with your friends but most of the time it's difficult to find a ruling in the vast amount of books that have been written for DnD and the spin offs that have come about.

I have been a DM for a few years, and I still get rules wrong all the time, this website is designed to help with that.
